## ML Project: Single-cell Classification in Nematodes

This project explores machine learning approaches for the analysis and classification of
single-cell data from nematodes.

Based on gene expression profiles, the goal is to identify and classify distinct cell types
using unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, including dimensionality reduction and
clustering techniques such as Leiden clustering.

### Focus
- Single-cell gene expression data
- Cell-type identification and clustering
- Machine learning workflows for biological data

### Methods & Tools
- Python
- Single-cell data analysis pipelines
- Dimensionality reduction and clustering (e.g. Leiden)
- Data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation

This project was developed as part of a hands-on machine learning course with a strong
focus on practical data analysis and biological interpretation.
